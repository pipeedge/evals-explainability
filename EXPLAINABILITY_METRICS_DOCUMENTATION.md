1. **Technical Quality Metrics** - Objective measures of explanation structure and readability
2. **Semantic Quality Metrics** - Content accuracy and relevance assessment
3. **User Experience Metrics** - Subjective user feedback and comprehension measures
4. **Attention Analysis Metrics** - Neural attention pattern analysis for interpretability

## 2. Detailed Metrics Documentation

### 2.1 Technical Quality Metrics

#### 2.1.1 Length Appropriateness Score
- **Definition**: Measures whether explanation length is optimal for comprehension
- **Formula**: `length_score = max(0, 1 - |word_count - 150| / 150)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates optimal length (~150 words)
- **Rationale**: Based on cognitive load theory - explanations should be neither too brief nor too verbose

#### 2.1.2 Readability Score
- **Definition**: Assesses text readability based on average word length
- **Formula**: `readability_score = max(0, 1 - |avg_word_length - 5| / 5)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates optimal readability (~5 characters per word)
- **Rationale**: Shorter words generally improve comprehension and accessibility

#### 2.1.3 Structure Score
- **Definition**: Evaluates presence of structured elements that enhance comprehension
- **Indicators**: Numbered lists (1., 2.), bold text (**), bullet points (-, •)
- **Formula**: `structure_score = min(1.0, structure_count / 3)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates well-structured explanation
- **Rationale**: Structured explanations improve information retention and navigation

### 2.2 Semantic Quality Metrics

#### 2.2.1 Semantic Similarity
- **Definition**: Measures semantic alignment between generated explanation and ground truth
- **Implementation**: Uses SentenceTransformer embeddings with cosine similarity
- **Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Formula**: `similarity = cosine_similarity(emb1, emb2)`
- **Range**: [-1, 1] where 1.0 indicates perfect semantic alignment
- **Innovation**: Multi-metric similarity computation with adaptive weighting

#### 2.2.2 Content Coverage
- **Definition**: Measures the proportion of ground truth concepts covered in explanation
- **Formula**: `coverage = |explanation_words ∩ ground_truth_words| / |ground_truth_words|`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates complete concept coverage
- **Rationale**: Ensures explanations address all relevant aspects of the failure

### 2.3 Attention Analysis Metrics

#### 2.3.1 Attention Concentration
- **Definition**: Measures how focused attention is on specific input-output token pairs
- **Formula**: `concentration = max(attention_weights) - mean(attention_weights)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where higher values indicate more focused attention
- **Interpretation**: High concentration suggests the model identifies specific failure points

#### 2.3.2 Attention Dispersion
- **Definition**: Measures the entropy of attention distribution across tokens
- **Formula**: `dispersion = entropy(attention_weights.flatten())`
- **Range**: [0, ∞] where higher values indicate more distributed attention
- **Interpretation**: High dispersion suggests the model considers multiple factors

#### 2.3.3 Attention Variance
- **Definition**: Measures the variability in attention weights
- **Formula**: `variance = var(attention_weights)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where higher values indicate more variable attention patterns
- **Interpretation**: High variance suggests the model discriminates between important and unimportant tokens

#### 2.3.4 Attention Sparsity
- **Definition**: Measures the proportion of attention weights below a threshold
- **Formula**: `sparsity = mean(attention_weights < 0.1)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where higher values indicate sparser attention
- **Interpretation**: High sparsity suggests the model focuses on few key tokens

### 2.4 User Experience Metrics

#### 2.4.1 User Comprehension

- **Collection**: User feedback surveys or expert evaluation
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates perfect comprehension
- **Rationale**: Direct measure of explanation effectiveness

#### 2.4.2 User Satisfaction
- **Definition**: Subjective measure of user satisfaction with explanation quality
- **Collection**: User feedback surveys
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates complete satisfaction
- **Rationale**: Important for adoption and trust

#### 2.4.3 User Trust
- **Definition**: Measure of user confidence in the explanation's accuracy
- **Collection**: User feedback surveys
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates complete trust
- **Rationale**: Critical for explainability system adoption

#### 2.4.4 User Actionability
- **Definition**: Measure of how actionable the explanation is for users
- **Collection**: User feedback surveys
- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates highly actionable explanation
- **Rationale**: Ensures explanations lead to practical improvements

### 2.5 Causality Analysis Metrics

#### 2.5.1 Granger Causality Score
- **Definition**: Measures temporal causality between input features and failure outcomes
- **Formula**: `causality = mean(|correlation(x[t-lag], y[t])|)`
- **Range**: [0, 1] where higher values indicate stronger causal relationships
- **Innovation**: Combines multiple lag correlations for robust causality detection

#### 2.5.2 Mutual Information Score
- **Definition**: Measures information-theoretic dependency between variables
- **Formula**: `MI = Σ p(x,y) * log(p(x,y) / (p(x) * p(y)))`
- **Range**: [0, ∞] where higher values indicate stronger dependencies
- **Advantage**: Captures non-linear relationships missed by correlation

### 2.6 Recommendation Quality Metrics

#### 2.6.1 Expected Impact Score

- **Range**: [0, 1] where 1.0 indicates perfect alignment
- **Stakeholders**: Developers, Managers, Researchers, End Users

## 3. Quality Assessment Framework

### 3.1 Overall Quality Computation

```

- User Satisfaction: 0.15
- Structure Score: 0.10
- Readability Score: 0.10

### 3.2 Confidence Assessment

The framework computes overall confidence using weighted aggregation:

```
overall_confidence = 0.4 * classification_confidence + 
                    0.4 * root_cause_confidence + 
                    0.2 * recommendation_confidence
```
