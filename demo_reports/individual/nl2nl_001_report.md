## 2. Detailed Analysis

### Input

```

        Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Rising global temperatures 
        have led to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. Scientists 
        have established clear evidence that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil 
        fuels, are the primary cause of recent climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
        Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C 
        since pre-industrial times. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
        and transition to renewable energy sources to limit further warming to 1.5°C above 
        pre-industrial levels.
        
```

### Model Output (Failed)

```

        Climate change is happening and it's getting warmer. Ice is melting and there are more 
        storms. Some scientists think humans might be involved through cars and factories. 
        The temperature has gone up by about 2°C in the last 100 years. We should probably 
        do something about it eventually.
        
```

### Reference Output (Correct)

```

        Climate change, driven primarily by human activities like fossil fuel burning, has caused 
        global temperatures to rise by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times. This has resulted in 
        melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. The IPCC emphasizes 
        the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy 
        to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis Report

**1. Analysis of Input Intent:**

The input text is a formal passage discussing climate change, its causes, and its effects. The core request or primary function of this input data appears to be to inform or educate the reader about the issue of climate change, emphasizing its severity and the need for urgent action. Key constraints or requirements specified in the passage include citing specific evidence (e.g., the 1.1°C rise in global temperatures) and referencing authoritative sources (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

**2. Key Discrepancies Observed:**

- The model output omits critical details, such as the role of human activities (specifically, the burning of fossil fuels) in causing climate change.
- It simplifies complex information, stating "some scientists think humans might be involved" instead of acknowledging clear evidence.
- The temperature rise is inaccurately reported as 2°C over the last 100 years, instead of 1.1°C since pre-industrial times.
- The urgency and specific actions needed (reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy) are downplayed.

**3. Explanation of Failure:**

These discrepancies align with the "Loss of Key Information" failure category because they involve omitting or distorting critical details from the original passage that were essential for conveying its message accurately. The model failed to preserve key facts (e.g., human activities causing climate change, specific temperature increase) and authoritative references, leading to a simplified and less accurate representation of the topic.

**4. Inferred Root Cause:**

The most likely reason for this failure is that the model struggled with preserving complex information and nuances from the original text during the natural language-to-natural language (NL2NL) transformation task. This struggle might stem from limitations in its training data or algorithms, particularly those related to attention mechanisms and information retention over longer sequences of text. The model's tendency to simplify and generalize may have led it to overlook critical details and context-specific information, resulting in a less accurate output that failed to meet the requirements for accurately conveying key messages about climate change.
