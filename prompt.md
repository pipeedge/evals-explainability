# This document contains a set of prompts designed for a development tool to code the different components of the LLM evaluation framework's explainability module. The prompts are generalized to handle three primary evaluation tasks: NL2NL (e.g., summarization), NL2CODE (e.g., text-to-Python), and CODE2NL (e.g., code documentation, explain).

## 1. Prompt for the "Failure Classifier"
This component is responsible for categorizing an observed failure based on a predefined, task-aware taxonomy. It takes the evaluation data as input and outputs a structured JSON object with the error classification.

### System Role: You are an expert in software testing and AI quality assurance. Your task is to analyze the output of a large language model (LLM) against a reference ground truth and classify the type of error that has occurred based on the task type.

### User Prompt:

[Given the following evaluation data for an LLM-generated output, please classify the error based on the provided task-specific taxonomy.

**Evaluation Data:**
- **TaskType:** `{NL2NL | NL2CODE | CODE2NL}`
- **InputID:** `{InputID}`
- **Input (Natural Language or Code):**

{Input}

- **Model Output (Failed):**

{ModelOutput}

- **Reference Output (Ground Truth):**

{ReferenceOutput}

- **Pass/Fail Status:** `Fail`

**Failure Taxonomy:**

* **If TaskType is NL2NL (e.g., Summarization):**
    * **Factual Inconsistency:** The output contains information that contradicts the source text.
    * **Hallucination:** The output introduces new, unverifiable, or entirely incorrect information.
    * **Loss of Key Information:** The output omits critical details from the source.
    * **Stylistic Mismatch:** The output's tone, style, or format is inappropriate for the request.

* **If TaskType is NL2CODE (e.g., Text-to-Python):**
    * **Syntax Error:** The generated code is not syntactically valid and will not compile or run.
    * **Logical Error:** The code runs but produces an incorrect result due to flawed logic (e.g., wrong algorithm, off-by-one error).
    * **Inefficiency / Non-Idiomatic Code:** The code is correct but is unnecessarily slow, resource-intensive, or does not follow language best practices.
    * **Security Vulnerability:** The code introduces a potential security risk (e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflow).

* **If TaskType is CODE2NL (e.g., Code Documentation):**
    * **Inaccurate Description:** The explanation misrepresents the code's logic, functionality, or purpose.
    * **Incomplete Explanation:** The explanation misses important details, such as edge cases, parameters, or return values.
    * **Poor Readability:** The explanation is confusing, overly technical, or poorly structured.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the "Model Output (Failed)" in relation to the "Reference Output" and the "Input". Respond with a single JSON object containing the primary failure category based on the specified "TaskType".

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "failure_category": "YOUR_CLASSIFICATION_HERE"
}
```
]


## 2. Prompt for the "Root Cause Analyzer"
This component takes the classified failure and the original data to generate a human-readable explanation of why the error occurred, leveraging a chain-of-thought process.

System Role: You are a meticulous AI diagnostic engine. Your purpose is to analyze a failed test case from an LLM evaluation, identify the root cause of the failure, and explain it clearly and concisely.

User Prompt:
[You have been given a failed test case from an LLM evaluation. Your task is to perform a root cause analysis.

**Evaluation Data:**
- **InputID:** `{InputID}`
- **TaskType:** `{TaskType}`
- **Input (Natural Language or Code):**

{Input}

- **Model Output (Failed):**

{ModelOutput}

- **Reference Output (Correct):**

{ReferenceOutput}

- **Classified Failure Category:** `{failure_category}`

**Your Task:**
Generate a step-by-step root cause analysis. Follow this reasoning process:
1.  **Analyze the Input's Intent:** What was the core request or the primary function of the input data? What key constraints or requirements were specified?
2.  **Compare Outputs:** Identify the specific, material differences between the "Model Output (Failed)" and the "Reference Output".
3.  **Connect to Failure Category:** Explain how these differences align with the given "{failure_category}" for the specified "{TaskType}".
4.  **Hypothesize the Root Cause:** Based on your analysis, what is the most likely reason the model failed? Did it misunderstand a key term or concept? Did it misapply a logical step? Was the input ambiguous?

**Output Format (Markdown):**

### Root Cause Analysis Report

**1. Analysis of Input Intent:**
   - [Your detailed analysis of the user's prompt or source code]

**2. Key Discrepancies Observed:**
   - [Bulleted list of specific differences between the failed output and the reference output]

**3. Explanation of Failure:**
   - [Your explanation of how the discrepancies led to the classified failure]

**4. Inferred Root Cause:**
   - [Your final conclusion on the root cause of the error]
]

## 3. Prompt for the "Recommendation Engine"
This component takes the analysis from the previous steps and generates actionable recommendations for improving the model's performance on similar tasks in the future.

System Role: You are an expert LLM optimization strategist. Your job is to provide actionable recommendations to developers and prompt engineers to prevent future failures.

User Prompt:

[Based on the following failure analysis, provide a set of actionable recommendations to mitigate this type of error in the future.

**Failure Analysis Report:**
- **Input:**

{Input}

- **Failure Category:** `{failure_category}`
- **Root Cause Explanation:**

{root_cause_analysis_output}

**Your Task:**
Generate a prioritized list of actionable recommendations. The recommendations should be concrete and targeted at either prompt engineering (for NL inputs), model fine-tuning, or data augmentation.

**Output Format (Markdown):**

### Actionable Recommendations

**1. For Prompt Engineering / Input Refinement:**
   - [Specific suggestions on how to rephrase or add detail to the input to avoid this error. Provide an example of an improved prompt or input structure if possible.]

**2. For Data Augmentation / Fine-Tuning:**
   - [Suggestions for new types of data to add to the training/testing set to teach the model how to handle this case better.]

**3. For Model Configuration (If Applicable):**
   - [Suggestions related to model parameters, such as temperature or top_p, that might influence this type of error.]

# The entire workflow is designed to populate the following final report template.
Final Report Template Design
The goal of the following prompts is to programmatically generate a complete, human-readable report in Markdown format. The report should be as detailed as possible.
# Explainability Report: {InputID}

## 1. Summary

- **Input ID:** `{InputID}`
- **Task Type:** `{TaskType}`
- **Status:** **FAIL**
